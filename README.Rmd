**Note**: We aim to keep visR maintained, but cannot commit to any future development. For all your KM plot needs, we would recommend checking out [ggsurvit](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/).  

The goal of visR is to enable fit-for-purpose, reusable clinical and medical research focused visualizations and tables with sensible defaults and based on sound [graphical principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/).

[Package documentation](https://openpharma.github.io/visR/)

## Motivation

By using a common package for visualising data analysis results in the clinical development process, we want to have a **positive influence** on 

* **choice of visualisation** by making it easy explore different visualisation and to use impactful visualisations fit-for-purpose
* effective visual communication by making it easy to **implement best practices** 

We are not judging on what visualisation you chose for your research question, but want to facilitate and support good practice.

You can read more about the philosophy and architecture in the [repo wiki](https://github.com/openpharma/visR/wiki).
