**Note**: We aim to keep visR maintained, but cannot commit to any
future development. For all your KM plot needs, we would recommend
checking out [ggsurvit](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/).

The goal of visR is to enable fit-for-purpose, reusable clinical and
medical research focused visualizations and tables with sensible
defaults and based on sound [graphical
principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/).

[Package documentation](https://openpharma.github.io/visR/)

## Motivation

By using a common package for visualising data analysis results in the
clinical development process, we want to have a **positive influence**
on

- **choice of visualisation** by making it easy explore different
  visualisation and to use impactful visualisations fit-for-purpose
- effective visual communication by making it easy to **implement best
  practices**

We are not judging on what visualisation you chose for your research
question, but want to facilitate and support good practice.

You can read more about the philosophy and architecture in the [repo
wiki](https://github.com/openpharma/visR/wiki).
