The goal of visR is to enable fit-for-purpose, reusable clinical and
medical research focused visualizations and tables with sensible
defaults and based on sound graphical principles.

## Motivation

clinical development process, we want to have a **positive influence**
on

  - **choice of visualisation** by making it easy explore different
    visualisation and to use impactful visualisations fit-for-purpose
  - effective visual communication by making it easy to **implement best
    practices**

We are not judging on what visualisation you chose for your research
question, but want facilitate to make you do your work as you need it\!

You can read more about the philosophy and architecture in the repo
